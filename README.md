# Introduction

A car company technical test. I decided to see how I could use React Hooks to address the problem of building a fairly complex form and include validation. 

# Getting Started

Car company X wants to introduce a new interest free car loan.
Using React
 Create a web application that will allow one of our Product Consultants to produce a
payment schedule for the new loan scheme.
 The application should allow the Product Consultant to input a vehicle price, deposit
amount, delivery date and select from 1, 2 or 3 year finance options.
 There is a minimum 15% deposit.
 For the first month add an £88 arrangement fee, the last a £20 completion fee. These values
should be easily configurable.
 Payments are due on the first Monday of each month, beginning the month after delivery.
 The completed application should calculate and display a quote showing a summary of the
loan and a payment schedule showing monthly payments with date and amount due.
 Using this API display the top six vehicles which may be affordable based on the monthly
payments
XXXXXX Mock data supplied
This will return a JSON response. We&#39;re most interested in the `searchResults` array.
 Your code should reflect clean coding principles and contain tests.
